//! Batched insertion for [`BTreeMap`].
//!
//! [`BTreeMap::insert_many`] inserts a stream of pairs while holding the current
//! root-to-leaf path in memory, so that each modified node is written to stable memory
//! once the input moves past it rather than once per key. [`BulkInsert`] is that held
//! path, and [`PathLevel`] is one level of it.
//!
//! # Attributing the cost
//!
//! Building with the `bench_scope` feature splits a batch into four canbench scopes:
//!
//! - `bulk_insert_release` — a node leaving the path: written out if dirty, else returned
//!   to the node cache
//! - `bulk_insert_descend` — taking one child out of the cache and recording its bounds
//! - `bulk_insert_leaf` — placing the entry, *including* any split it triggers
//! - `bulk_insert_split` — the split cascade, nested inside the previous one
//!
//! So the cost of placing an entry with no split is `bulk_insert_leaf` minus
//! `bulk_insert_split`. The feature is off by default and adds significant overhead, so
//! the numbers are for comparing parts against each other within one run, not against
//! results measured without it.
